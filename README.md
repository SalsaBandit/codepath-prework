## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite applications: Instagram, Gmail, Slack
Favorite features: Dark mode, aesthetic visuals and minimalist Ui, colorful, ability to edit messages, ability to send large files and videos, ability to unsend messages or emails

An app that I want to build is to aid developers in note taking and give a break down of how they might implement ideas that they come up with into actual code for example if someone says they want to build a car racing game the app would suggest the recommended programming languages and what files and functionalities to implement to start with.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

building and connecting logic with UI
setting up the IDE
researching and learning about the language
